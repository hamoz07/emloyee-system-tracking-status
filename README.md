#description

I created this project to simulate Customer Relations Management system in companies,
I used https://astra.datastax.com/ for the database because I am not a backend developer.

#features

- by entering the employee name (the owner)
- by entering the employee status with the project
- by entering the employee photo
- and the problem title
- descriping the problem
- progress of the project out of 100
- the problem category (technical problem,connection issue, etc..)

#usage

- due to that https://astra.datastax.com/ stops the database after 2 days of not using it, I recorder the whole project in the below record
